# ringo
Ring (circular) buffer implementation in Go which is concurrency safe. 

Not meant for use at this point. This will be a good test use case for generics

Can wrap this implementaion with a concrete type. [See article](https://www.calhoun.io/using-code-generation-to-survive-without-generics-in-go/).
